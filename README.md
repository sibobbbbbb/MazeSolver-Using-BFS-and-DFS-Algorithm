## General Info
This project is a graphical maze solver application built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides an interactive way to visualize maze solving algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). The application generates a maze, sets random start and end points, and allows the user to solve the maze using the selected algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)
- Collections (deque for BFS and DFS)
- Random (for maze and point generation)

## Features
- Generates random mazes of customizable size
- Random start and end points that ensure solvability
- Visual representation of the maze and the solving process
- Supports BFS and DFS algorithms for maze solving
- Displays the length of the path, time taken, and the number of explored cells

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sibobbbbbb/MazeSolver-Using-BFS-and-DFS-Algorithm.git
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash 
    cd MazeSolver-Using-BFS-and-DFS-Algorithm
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
